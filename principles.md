# Principles
- Hire smart people and empower them to use those smarts
- Diversity matters


## Culture is not free food and ping pong

Building complex software systems is hard. Building a successful Startup is hard. Working in teams is hard. Working remotely across large timezone differences is REALLY hard. To be successful in the long run it is important to identify the type of culture that you need to foster, and put in place the guidelines for the behaviour that you need to make this a reality. Free food and ping pong are great, but these do not equal a strong culture.

Although we love our handball court in the Brisbane office, and it offers a fantastic release for the team, and bonding opportunity this is not the key to our culture.

As a SaaS startup we have looked at the mindsets and cultures that have repeatedly led to success in similar environments. Much of this inspiration has come from approaches such as The Lean Startup, The Agile Manifesto and associated views on high performing teams, and the approaches of successful SaaS companies such as Spotify, Atlassian, Google, GitLab and Basecamp to name a few.

## Build-Measure-Learn

In a startup environment process and culture is first and foremost based on the principles of Validated Learning and Build-Measure-Lean from The Lean Startup methodology. You don't have time or money to waste so the most important thing is to make sure that you're building the right thing and putting your effort into the right areas. A big part of this this is to validate your ideas by shipping product early, get feedback and pivot on that basis.

## Fail Fast, Fail Often

Related to the validated learning principle, the concept of fail fast, fail often is intended to foster a culture of experimentation and innovation. It's ok, in fact it's even encouraged to try something and fail, the key here is to tackle the most risky part of an experiment first to see if you can force it to fail. The concept is that many things are going to fail, and it is best to get to this point as quickly as possible to force a decision to pivot, rather than continuing to spend time on something that is not going to work.

## High Performing Teams are Empowered

Numerous studies and reviews of successful companies and teams have highlighted the importance of empowering teams for success across all types of situations and organisations, but particularly when it comes to building high quality software products. Empowered teams are more engaged and more efficient than those that are micro-managed or not given the tools, autonomy and authority to make decisions and guide their own work.


## Blameless Culture

By default we lean toward a Blameless Culture because we feel that it is important to encourage people to surface issues and concerns as quickly as possible so that they can be addressed, and also to foster innovation and experiementation as per the fail fast, fail often principle.

Living this on a day-to-day basis means that we raise things issues as we find them, but when you do this try to do so in a blameless manner, be factual and not personal about it. Equally, if something that you have done is raised or pointed out, don't assume you are being blamed, we just want to continue to improve.

We support this culture through a number of practices such as regular psychological safety surveys and [Blameless Postmortems](https://landing.google.com/sre/sre-book/chapters/postmortem-culture/).

## Scale Horizontally

This principle is reflected in our cross-functional team (squad) structures. Each of these teams has been designed with all the skills and experience that they require to deliver great software in the area of their responsibility.
