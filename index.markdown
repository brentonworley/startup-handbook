# Startup Handbook

## Inspiration
This handbook is completely inspired by the work of GitLab and their [handbook-first](https://about.gitlab.com/company/culture/all-remote/handbook-first-documentation/) approach.

## Why a handbook
I have spent much of my time since the mid 2000's working with and building high performing engineering teams. During this time I have seen a lot of change across the industry. Working across corporate, consulting, and startup environments, I have pieced together what I believe to be the key building blocks that are required to set up Engineering teams for success. Some of these have changed substantially over the past 15+ years, but many have remained remarkably stable. The intent of this handbook is my effort to document these in a way that can be easily consumed, but also forms a record of my learnings, and can be continuously updated as new ideas, tools and processes evolve and gain traction.
