# Startup Handbook

## Inspiration
This handbook is completely inspired by the work of GitLab and their [handbook-first](https://about.gitlab.com/company/culture/all-remote/handbook-first-documentation/) approach.

## Why a handbook

I have spent much of my time since the mid 2000's working with and building high performing engineering teams. During this time I have seen a lot of change across the industry. Working across corporate, consulting, and startup environments, I have pieced together what I believe to be the key building blocks that are required to set up Engineering teams for success. Some of these have changed substantially over the past 15+ years, but many have remained remarkably stable. The intent of this handbook is my effort to document these in a way that can be easily consumed, but also forms a record of my learnings, and can be continuously updated as new ideas, tools and processes evolve and gain traction.

Documenting these thoughts and topics as a handbook is to encourage collaboration. This work and the ideas contained here are by no means all my own, and I believe that by creating this as a GitHub project this may encourage and enable open discussion and collaboration to continually refine the work here.

## What's Included

*A brief summary of the scope of the handbook.*

## It's all about Culture

> It doesn't make sense to hire smart people and then tell them what to do;
> we hire smart people so they can tell us what to do.
>
> *Steve Jobs*


> Great things in Business are never done by one person, they're done by a team of people.
>
> *Steve Jobs*


> Train people well enough so they **can leave,** treat them well enough so they **don't want to.**
>
> *Sir Richard Branson*


> Take care of your employees and they will take care of your business. It's as simple as that.
>
> *Sir Richard Branson*


### Mission Driven

The likelihood of success is greatly enhanced if your team can get behind and align with a mission that they believe in. Hiring people that buy into your company vision and mission is critical, this provides the first level of motivation for people who want to be at work and do work that is meaningful.

### Empowerment



### Be Authentic

### Your team is not your family



In early 2017 we made a strategic decision to in-source our Engineering capability as we launched our product beyond the first customer. As we grew that team over the next 2-3 years we have committed a considerable amount of our time and energy to not only building great product but also defining and constantly refining our ways of working and building a strong team culture.

We do this primarily because we all want to love coming to work. As a company we are passionate about our mission and our potential to impact the way people work, and a crucial dependency on the ability of the company to achieve that potential is a high performing Engineering team. What's this got to do with us loving our work? If you fundamentally love what you do, and the culture of your work place empowers you to do that to the best of your ability then it makes sense that you're going to both love coming to work and at the same time deliver great results.

For any growing startup the ability to attract, develop and keep engineering talent is crucial first for survival and then to thrive and grow. For a team to really grow, support from the company leadership and management is important, but really sustainable growth comes when the team own the culture as this allows them to lead it rather than just follow.

A big part of this culture has been an almost obsessive focus on iterative and continual improvement. As the team has grown, and we have brought in new skills and new ideas we have constantly been refining every part of our Engineering process and ways of working. In the early days much of this was discussed and debated in face-to-face meetings and potentially documented in our wiki, or baked into our workflows in JIRA. This was sufficient as a small, predominantly co-located team as everyone understood their role, the expectations and process and if they had any concerns or questions they just needed to ask.
