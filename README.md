Handbook inspired by GitLab handbook first approach to document the things that I have found to be useful/important in setting up engineering teams in a startup environment.

# Installation

The following are basic steps to get Jekyll running on a local development environment and configured with GitHub Pages.



## Installing Jekyll

If you have already install the following:

1. Ruby
2. Bundler, a Ruby **gem** to manage you project's dependencies
3. Jekyll

## Set Up your site

Create a new empty repository on GitHub for your Project say `my-project`.

> **Warning:** Remove any visible files, such as the README.MD to another directory
> copy the files back once the site has been set up.

Run the following command to create all the necessary starter files and directories:

    > jekyll new .

**Add stuff in here about the Gem and config.yml files**

Run the following commands to update the Gemfile.lock and build the project

    > bundle update

    > bundle install

Startup the local Jekyll server:

    > bundle exec jekyll server --watch
